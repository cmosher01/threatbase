Before "Stand Up," Ian mentions Chicago. The only shows Minor Threat
played in Chicago were August 3, 1981, and April 1983. This is clearly
an early show, way before 1983, because they don't play "Little
Friend," or "No Reason," or any of their later songs. Also note
that O'Banion's closed in 1981 or 1982.
