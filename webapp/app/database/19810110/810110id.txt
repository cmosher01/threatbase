Before the first song, Ian thanks Black Market Baby for letting them play tonight.
Minor Threat only ever played two shows with Black Market Baby: January 10, 1981,
and April 4, 1981 ("Banned in DC," p. 176). Also, before "Guilty of Being White," Ian mentions the
Untouchables' last show as an upcoming event that people should go see.
According to the Flex Your Head album insert, the Untouchables broke up
in January of 1981, so that rules out the April 4 show.
Note that this show has the same set list as 1982/08/01.
