At one point during the show, between songs, Ian says, "Hello, New Jersey."
I don't think they're playing in New Jersey, but they are probably
near there. He calls "Little Friend" a "new song," so this must be
early in 1982. Also, they don't play "Betray" or "Look Back and
Laugh," so it's probably before October 30, 1982 (where they
play the unfinished versions of those songs). That leaves, according
to my show list, New York or Boston as the only candidates, and
New York is probably the best bet.
