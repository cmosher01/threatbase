After the band plays "Screaming At a Wall," Ian says to
the audience, "Remember this is the last Saturday before
Christmas. Go get your shopping done." So that places the show
in December. The only December the band was together, as a
five piece, was 1982. So that makes it Dec. 18, 1982.
Hansgen's tour list shows "12/82 NYC CB's" and shows that
it was video taped.
