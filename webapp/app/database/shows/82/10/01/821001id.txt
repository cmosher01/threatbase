Before the first song, Ian thanks "Maryland University" for giving the
band their "one Coke each." After the band plays one song, Ian jokingly
says that the next band, Velvet Monkeys, are up next. The only show at
University of Maryland, with the Velvet Monkeys, is October 1, 1982,
according to "Banned in DC," pp. 88, 176.
