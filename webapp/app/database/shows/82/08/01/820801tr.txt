If you wanna fight or if you wanna get fucking physical,
don't do it back there. You do it right here, all right?
If those people wanna stand... if they wanna stand there,
that's OK. They paid... Listen, if they wanna stand back
there, it's OK. They paid their money. Anyone who came
tonight's all right. But if you wann fucking move, if you
wanna fight, you wanna have a good time, you come up
here, all right? Don't take it back there. Let them have
their time. Another thing: if you fucking wanna throw
something... and someone hit one of my friends with a
bottle. If you or anyone back there wanna throw something,
man, let us fucking catch you. You got that? Fucking
throw shit, man... fucking pussy. The 9:30's nice enough
to have us, we'll have to be nice enough not to hurt
their partons... unless they hurt us first.
