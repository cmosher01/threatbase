At the very start of the show, Ian says that this is their
very last show before going home, after 7 weeks on the road.
Hansgen's tour list shows the last show as "May 2 Cincinnati, OH."
Note that Newport, KY, is just over the river from Cincinnati.
The web site for the Jockey Club shows "Minor Threat" playing
on 5/2/83 (it also lists 4/2/83, but this is an error, because
Minor Threat were at Rollerworks on 4/2/83).
