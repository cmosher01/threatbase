This is Minor Threat's third-to-last show of their
big 1983 tour. Some interesting things Ian mentions
between songs at this show include: that Minor Threat
played "Cashing In" at one show; that they are ending
their tour Tuesday [May 3] [next show May 1 in Kalamazoo,
then May 2 in Newport, then going home May 3]; also that
they wrote "Sob Story" in Tesco Vee's basement.
