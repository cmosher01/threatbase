After playing "No Reason" Ian mentions tomorrow's show
in Kalamazoo with Negative Approach. According to Hansgen's
tour list, Kalamazoo was May 1, so this show is April 30
at Ecorse (near Detroit), Michigan. Note that the tour
list shows "Serbian Hall" in Kalamazoo, but Serbian Hall
is actually the venue for this show, Ecorse/Detroit, as
shown in an actual flyer for this show that I have:
"MINOR THREAT OUT OF STEP, McDonalds, Flesh Columns, April 30,
Serbian Church Hall..." with directions of how to get there.
