This is, I believe, Minor Threat's first (home) show after the end
of their big 1983 tour. The chorus of Small Man Big Mouth sounds
different than usual. The guitar is only playing an open E chord.
This is similar to the sound from the next night's show, Love Hall,
where Steve Hansgen is not present. I believe then that Steve
is not at this show either, and Brian Baker is playing bass instead.
