This is the second show on Minor Threat's 1983 tour.
The date is suspect; Nui Hansgen's list shows the tour starting on the 13th,
so this show should be after that. However, the 4th show is on the 14th,
so this show couldn't be on the 13th, but the Mar. 5 seems too close to the
previous show on Mar. 4 in Massachusetts. So more like Mar. 10 or 11.
