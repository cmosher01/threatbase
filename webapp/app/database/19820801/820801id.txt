Before the first song, Ian mentions that they are in the 9:30 Club.
The only shows Minor Threat played 9:30 were August 1, 1982 (I think
that one is this show), and January 2, 1983 (which I cannot rule out).
Also they played there on the Dischord "Live" video, but that's
definitely not this show. Also they played there several times in 1981,
but I think this show is 1982.
Other than the fact that the bootleg tape I have is labeled "9:30,
D.C. 1982," I cannot find any other identifying features.
Note that this show has the same set list as 1981/01/10.
