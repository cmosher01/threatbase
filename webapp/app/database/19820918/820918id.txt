You can hear Ian talking about the PA company not getting paid,
and you can compare the song "Minor Threat" to the one on the video
and hear that they are the same. Also, on the video we can catch
a few glimpses of the band's set list taped up on an amplifier,
and it is the same as the songs on this tape.
