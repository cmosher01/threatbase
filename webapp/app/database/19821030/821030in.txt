The first song is "Look Back and Laugh" but with no singing, and
then it goes right into another song, which is unreleased. It sounds
like an old version of "Betray"
with different music. The verse has lyrics "You betrayed me by
growing up." I haven't heard this song played anywhere else but here.
Note that my tape of this show cuts off after "It Follows."
