"ident": "At one point during the show, between songs, Ian says, \"Hello,\
  \ New Jersey.\"\nI don't think they're playing in New Jersey, but they\
  \ are probably\nnear there. He calls \"Little Friend\" a \"new song,\"\
  \ so this must be\nearly in 1982. Also, they don't play \"Betray\" or\
  \ \"Look Back and\nLaugh,\" so it's probably before October 30, 1982 (where\
  \ they\nplay the unfinished versions of those songs). That leaves, according\n\
  to my show list, New York or Boston as the only candidates, and\nNew York\
  \ is probably the best bet."
