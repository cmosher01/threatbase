"ident": "The bootleg I have says, \"North Carolina 1983.\" The only two\n\
  shows in NC in 1983 were Chapel Hill and Charlotte, according\nto Hansgen's\
  \ original list of shows. It could be either of\nthese shows; there aren't\
  \ many other identifying factors."

"info": "This is the second show on Minor Threat's 1983 tour.\nThe date\
  \ is suspect; Nui Hansgen's list shows the tour starting on the 13th,\n\
  so this show should be after that. However, the 4th show is on the 14th,\n\
  so this show couldn't be on the 13th, but the Mar. 5 seems too close to\
  \ the\nprevious show on Mar. 4 in Massachusetts. So more like Mar. 10\
  \ or 11."
