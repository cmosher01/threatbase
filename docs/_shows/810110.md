"ident": "Before the first song, Ian thanks Black Market Baby for letting\
  \ them play tonight.\nMinor Threat only ever played two shows with Black\
  \ Market Baby: January 10, 1981,\nand April 4, 1981 (\"Banned in DC,\"\
  \ p. 176). Also, before \"Guilty of Being White,\" Ian mentions the\n\
  Untouchables' last show as an upcoming event that people should go see.\n\
  According to the Flex Your Head album insert, the Untouchables broke up\n\
  in January of 1981, so that rules out the April 4 show.\nNote that this\
  \ show has the same set list as 1982/08/01."
