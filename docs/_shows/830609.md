"info": "This is, I believe, Minor Threat's first (home) show after the\
  \ end\nof their big 1983 tour. The chorus of Small Man Big Mouth sounds\n\
  different than usual. The guitar is only playing an open E chord.\nThis\
  \ is similar to the sound from the next night's show, Love Hall,\nwhere\
  \ Steve Hansgen is not present. I believe then that Steve\nis not at this\
  \ show either, and Brian Baker is playing bass instead."
