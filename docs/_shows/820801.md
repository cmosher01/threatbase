"ident": "Before the first song, Ian mentions that they are in the 9:30\
  \ Club.\nThe only shows Minor Threat played 9:30 were August 1, 1982 (I\
  \ think\nthat one is this show), and January 2, 1983 (which I cannot rule\
  \ out).\nAlso they played there on the Dischord \"Live\" video, but that's\n\
  definitely not this show. Also they played there several times in 1981,\n\
  but I think this show is 1982.\nOther than the fact that the bootleg tape\
  \ I have is labeled \"9:30,\nD.C. 1982,\" I cannot find any other identifying\
  \ features.\nNote that this show has the same set list as 1981/01/10."
