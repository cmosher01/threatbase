# The Complete Minor Threat Database

This is an archive of Minor Threat, the hardcore band from Georgetown, in Washington, D.C.
It has set lists from their live shows, some captured audio from tapes, scanned flyers,
information about records, and more. It also has information on early related bands of Ian MacKaye.

If you find any inaccurate or missing information, I would love to hear about it. Please
email me: [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) .
