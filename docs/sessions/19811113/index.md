## Skewbald/Grand Union & Rozzlyn Rangers

This session was recorded after the first Minor Threat band broke up when Lyle went to college, and before they re-united in 1982.
I have a demo tape of most of the session. Some songs from the sessions were released on Dischord 50 CD.
The Rozzlyn Rangers song was released on the 20 Years of Dischord box set.
