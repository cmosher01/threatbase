## Minor Threat 1981-08

I've found a version of Minor Threat's "Guilty of Being White" that is not a known released or demo version.
I have yet to be able to determine its origin.
It sounds as if it was recorded in a studio, but it is not the version released on the old album, nor
on the more recent "First Demo Tape" album.

<audio id="guilty" controls src="https://mosher.mine.nu/audio/threatbase/198108/guilty.mp3">Cannot play audio.</audio>

Listen in the second verse for
<button type="button" onclick="jump_to(31.5)">You blame me</button>
(at 0:31) where there is a distinct pause before "me" not found in any other known version.

Also note he says
<button type="button" onclick="jump_to(55.9)">19 years of my time</button>
(at 0:56) instead of "18 years," as on some older performances of this song.
