## Minor Threat 1980-11

I've found some unknown versions of early Minor Threat session recordings
(not the versions released on the old album, nor on the more recent "First Demo Tape" album).
I believe these are from the session recorded in Lyle's mother's basement, the session that
also included "Understand" released on Dischord 125.
